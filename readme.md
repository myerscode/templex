## Why this package is helpful?

This package will allow you to define stubs and then hydrate the template using PHP variables. 
As the engine uses RegEx it does not rely on using `eval` or including and running the code as PHP. 

This means that you are able to simply generate _*new*_ PHP (or any type of text content filled files for that matter) you need.

## Install

You can install this package via composer:

``` bash
composer require myerscode/templex
```
